## Learnings & Notes

* Understood the importance of indentation in Python and how it defines code blocks.
* Practiced using `if`/`elif`/`else` statements for various decision-making scenarios.
* Explored different ways to manipulate strings, including concatenation and formatting.
* Understood creating a list using a dictionary and producing results using functions.
* Practicing Loops using while as well as if/elif/else using functions
* the section about Bitwise Operators in Advanced Topics was difficult, I hope this is not requirement for use very often.
* Explored classes, understanding parent and child inheritance, as well as modifying variables methods.
* Practiced writing to a txt file and reading it back.
* Learned how to check if the file is closed using "if not file.closed: file.close()"
