# Understanding Flowise: ChatFlows vs AgentFlows

- Notes from ChatGPT conversations today

## üîπ What is a ChatFlow?

A **ChatFlow** is a standalone conversational pipeline, typically used for:

- Answering questions
- Conversational AI experiences
- Simple tasks like PDF Q&A, API calls, or web search

### Common Components in a ChatFlow:
- **LLM Node** (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
- **Retriever Node** (e.g., vector database, PDF loader)
- **Memory Node** (for storing conversation history)
- **Prompt Node** (to structure the LLM behavior)

### Example Use Cases:
- FAQ Bot
- Document-based Q&A
- Weather info lookup via API

## üîπ What is an AgentFlow?

An **AgentFlow** is a more intelligent and goal-directed flow. It uses **reasoning and planning** to decide what tools or actions to take.

### AgentFlow Features:
- Powered by nodes like `Agent Executor` or `Plan-and-Execute`
- Dynamically selects tools based on user input
- Can chain multiple steps to solve complex problems

### Example Use Cases:
- AI assistant that handles customer service tickets
- Research assistant that reads files and calls APIs
- Agents that make decisions across multiple tools

## üîÑ How They Work Together

Yes ‚Äî **AgentFlows utilize ChatFlows internally as tools**.

### Architecture Overview:
- Each tool the agent can use is built as a **ChatFlow**
- These ChatFlows are then **registered as tools** within the AgentFlow
- The Agent decides which ChatFlow to invoke based on the task

### Example:
1. ChatFlow A: Q&A over PDF documents
2. ChatFlow B: Calls external API for user data
3. ChatFlow C: Writes a summary email

‚û°Ô∏è AgentFlow can **reason**:  
_"To solve this query, I need to: read a PDF ‚Üí check API ‚Üí write response"_

| Feature               | ChatFlow                            | AgentFlow                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Purpose              | Single conversation or task         | Multi-step task resolution             |
| Tool Usage           | Static (pre-set tools)              | Dynamic (selects tools as needed)      |
| Reasoning Ability    | Limited                             | Full planning and reasoning            |
| Structure            | LLM + memory + prompt               | Agent + tools (ChatFlows)              |
| Use Case             | Q&A bot, API bot                    | Task assistant, automation agent       |

## üìÅ Tip that got my agent working

- Build **modular ChatFlows** for each tool you need.
- Reuse them inside **AgentFlows** to keep your flows maintainable and scalable.
