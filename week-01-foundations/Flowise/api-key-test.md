# OpenAI API Key Test Results

**Date:** 06/29/2025
**Flowise Version:** Cloud
**Time Spent:** 30 min

## Initial Setup
- Created OpenAI account: ✅
- Generated API key: ✅
- Accessed Flowise cloud: ✅

## First Attempt - Error Encountered
**Configuration:**
- Component used: ChatOpenAI only
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Test message: "Say hello"

**Error Message:** 
"Ending node must be either a Chain or Agent or Engine"

**What I Learned:**
Flowise needs both an AI model (ChatOpenAI) and a conversation manager (Chain) to work properly.  After I added an LLM chain to the flow, I noticed a second required field "Prompt", so I added a prompt template.

## Solution Applied
**Added Components:**
1. ChatOpenAI (AI model)
2. Conversation Chain (conversation manager)
3. Prompt Template

**Connection:**
ChatOpenAI output → Conversation Chain llm input

## Successful Test Results
**Test Message:** "are you working?"
**AI Response:** "Yes, I am currently working to assist you with any questions or tasks you may have. How can I help you today?"
**Status:** Success ✅

## Configuration Details
- **Model:** gpt-3.5-turbo
- **Temperature:** 0.7
- **Max Tokens:** 100
- **Estimated Cost:** ~$0.001

## Key Insights
- AI agents need both a model and a conversation manager
- Flowise error messages are helpful for troubleshooting
- The connection between components is crucial
- Testing with simple messages first is effective

## Next Steps
- [ ] Build first customer service agent
- [ ] Export this working chatflow as JSON
- [ ] Take screenshots of the working setup
- [ ] Document the complete workflow design
