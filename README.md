# Tracking my journey of attempting to learn AI agent development - from Flowise to Python

## About This Repository
I'm documenting my 12-week journey learning AI agent development, starting with visual tools like Flowise and progressing to Python programming. I am trying to learn some new tools to make tasks and processes easier. With an extensive background in operations, process improvement, and a resonable amount of SQL queries under my belt, I want to try to move into some different tech to continue to improve.  Per the new tech idea, I am using this AI generated plan to get to the AI Agent skill set. :)

## Learning Plan
- **Weeks 1-4**: Foundation & Visual Prototyping (Flowise), Python basics
- **Weeks 5-6**: Python Fundamentals for AI
- **Weeks 7-10**: Code-First Agent Development
- **Weeks 11-12**: Production & Deployment

## Current Progress
- Start Date: 06/29/2025
- Current Week: Week 1
- Projects Completed: 2

## Projects Portfolio
1. ✅ Customer Service Agent (Flowise → Python)
2. ✅ Weather Chatbot (Flowise → API -> Java)
