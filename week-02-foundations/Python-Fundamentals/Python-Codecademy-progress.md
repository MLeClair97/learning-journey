# Week 2: Python Fundamentals

## Learning Goals
Take Codecademy's "Python for Programmers" for Days 1-2, but approach it strategically:
**Day 1**: Focus On
 - Basic syntax differences from Python 2
 - Data structures (dictionaries, lists)
 - Control flow updates
**Day 2**: Focus On
 - Functions and lambda expressions
 - Object-oriented programming basics
 - Built-in data structures you'll use with pandas
**Skip/Skim:**
 - Anything that feels too basic from your Python 2 experience
 - Advanced OOP concepts you won't need immediately

## What "Python for Programmers" Covers:

 - Getting Started with Python - Python fundamentals review
 - Basic Syntax with Python - Review of basic syntax
 - Control Flow in Python - Flow of execution control
 - Functions - Writing functions including anonymous ones
 - Object-Oriented Programming in Python - OOP overview
 - Built-In Data Structures - Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, Queues and Stacks

## Python Class Key items to consider 
 - Review f-strings, comprehensions, and modern syntax
 - Practice with context managers and exception handling
 - Focus on features you'll use in data work
**Key Insigths**
- I will need to keep reviewing Python and doing some projects for practice at Codecademy to keep improving my knowledge and skills with basic programming.
