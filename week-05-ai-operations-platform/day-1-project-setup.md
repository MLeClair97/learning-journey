## 🎯 Objectives Achieved

### ✅ **Project Setup & Architecture**
- Created new GitHub repository: `ai-operations-supply-chain-eval`
- Established modular code structure with `src/` folders
- Set up proper separation: data processing, AI insights, visualizations
- Configured professional Streamlit application framework

### ✅ **Data Integration**
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Supply Chain Logistics Dataset (50 transactions)
- **Columns**: Product, Supplier, Warehouse Location, Logistics Partner, Shipping Method, Delivery Status, Total Cost, Delivery Date
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned dates, calculated performance metrics, created business intelligence functions
- **Enhancement**: Updated delivery dates to current timeframe for realistic demo

### ✅ **AI-Powered Analytics**
- **Risk Analysis Engine**: Built `generate_risk_analysis()` function
- **Business Intelligence**: AI identifies root causes, financial impact, actionable recommendations
- **Example Output**: "FastTrans has 45.5% delay rate vs FleetPro at 11.1% - recommend shifting volume"
- **Integration**: Modular AI insights in `src/ai_insights/operations_analyzer.py`

### ✅ **Visualization Platform**
- **8 Different Chart Types**: Stacked bars, heatmaps, gauges, donuts, bubble charts, dual-axis
- **Professional Styling**: Dark theme, consistent colors, executive-ready presentation
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover details, responsive design, proper legends
