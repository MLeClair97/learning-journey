## ðŸ“Š Daily Learning Log
### July 17, 2025 - Day 4 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Panda Data Sorting, Grouping and Aggregation Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python
- âœ… **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**:  Use raw strings (prefix with r) when calling my files, I need to sort_values(...) separately first before selecting fields and presenting the results.

### July 16, 2025 - Day 4 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Panda Data Filtering Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup
- âœ… **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**: Use .to_string(index=False) for clean console output, Always wrap conditions in parentheses when using & or | in pandas filters, Error handling: Check for and handle invalid or non-numeric values using pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')
- **Next Steps**: Pandas Additional Filtering, Sorting, Grouping and Aggregation

### July 15, 2025 - Day 3 Start
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup
- âœ… **Progress**: Learned pandas data loading and basic exploration using real-world data from Kaggle
- **Challenges**: Adjusting to pandas syntax vs SQL queries
- **Breakthroughs**: Understanding DataFrames as "smart spreadsheets"

### July 14, 2025 - Day 1-2 Completion
**Focus**: Python for Programmers (Codecademy)
- âœ… **Completed**: Full Codecademy Python for Programmers course
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup
- âœ… **Progress**: Began panda exploration + data sources
- **Key Takeaways**: Python will be ongoing practice but going from Python 2 to Python 3 was managable. Initial data activity with panda and csv worked well.
- **Next Steps**: Moving to Pandas/SQL translation work
