### August 01, 2025 - Day 13 Progress
**Focus**: AI API Integration
- ✅ **Completed**: Building a Complete AI Enhanced Application
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + OpenAI + SQL Queries + Streamlit + JSON + REST
- ✅ **Progress**: Learned how all the pieces built so far start coming together in one application
- **Key Takeaways**: REST APIs aren't about data location - they're about system communication. Today I learned to build the bridge between databases, AI services, and business applications. This architectural thinking is what I will need for future AI implementation roles.

### July 30, 2025 - Day 12 Progress
**Focus**: AI API Integration
- ✅ **Completed**: Prompt Engineering for Data Analysis
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + OpenAI + SQL Queries
- ✅ **Progress**: Learned use cases for chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting, as well as roles for specific target audience
- **Key Takeaways**: Prompt styles can be combined for a very thorough evaluation of data. A template can be used by selecting the type of evaluation, then feeding the required `variables` in the call.  Prompting will take some practice to get the full value of the process.  I see why there are people that specialize in this process.

### July 29, 2025 - Day 11 Progress
**Focus**: AI API Integration
- ✅ **Completed**: OpenAI API Fundamentals
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + OpenAI + SQL Queries
- ✅ **Progress**: Tested OpenAI API call successfull and ran a couple of test analysis on SQLite and SQLExpress data.
- **Key Takeaways**: Noticed that SQL analysis used primarily Chat Completion tokens at OpenAI. This is not very expensive for small datasets vs. what I had been testing with Flowise workflows. I understand that JSON output (vs. human readable text outputs) enables automated decision-making and integration with other systems, due to the structure.  This will be important moving forward.

### July 25, 2025 - Day 10 Progress
**Focus**: Database connections with Python
- ✅ **Completed**: SQLExpress with SQLAlchemy- Local Database Connection and querying
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + SQL Server Management Studio
- ✅ **Progress**: Installed SQLExpress and SQL Server Management Studio, added sample databases, connected and ran SQL extraction with pandas
- **Key Takeaways**: Had an issue connecting at first but sorted out the Server Management set up to resolve it.  Got my `.env` setting for SQL set up quickly. Once in the Server Manager, I finally felt comfortable with a familiar environment.  I was able to test my queries in there before adding inside a lot of other code in Jupyter.

### July 24, 2025 - Day 9 Progress
**Focus**: Database connections with Python
- ✅ **Completed**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy- Local Database Connection and querying
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + PostgreSQL + pgAdmin
- ✅ **Progress**: Learned how to install and use postgreSQL, connected and combined SQL extraction with pandas manipulation
- **Key Takeaways**: Struggled a but with the `.env` concept so this took two days for both query practice and securing the connection with `.env` and `gitignore`. Wrapping SQL queries in engine connection and execute functions was different but I was grateful for the pgAdmin so I had a semi-familiar interface to look at the sample data to see what I wanted to pull. I probably should have practiced looking at the data using python panda but old habits are slow to die.

### July 21, 2025 - Day 8 Progress
**Focus**: Database connections with Python
- ✅ **Completed**: SQLite3 - Local Database Connection and querying
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + SQLite3 self created database
- ✅ **Progress**: Enhanced data analysis skill by combining SQL extraction with pandas manipulation
- **Key Takeaways**: Created reusable `connect_to_database()` function with proper error handling, built `execute_query_to_dataframe()` function - the workhorse pattern for AI data work, learned and practiced with secure parameter passing to prevent SQL injection

### July 20, 2025 - Day 7 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ✅ **Completed**: Panda Cleaning and Transforming Data for SQL to Python translation exercises
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + Seaborn Databases
- ✅ **Progress**: Null evaluation and transforming data for additional information availability
- **Key Takeaways**: Learned fill options for missing which is new to me. Also, pivot and pivot table - I had not done these items with queries, just excel. Data filling makes me a little uncomfortable as I worry about data integrity but will evaluate should the situation arise.

### July 18, 2025 - Day 6 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ✅ **Completed**: Panda Data Merging and Joining Data Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + Dataframe in project / Seaborn Tips Database
- ✅ **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**: Merge, on, how is logical like joins in SQL. Suffixes are new as SQL can handle column names that are the same using table aliases. Concat with `.drop_duplicates()` functions like UNION, UNION ALL without that. Prefer to use `np.where()` rather than `pd.cut()` - it seems more logical and readable. By chance, learned \n next line formatting character to create a new line to space return data out. Also, using `observed=True` learned by a code update warning by Jupyter on one of my statements.
- 
### July 17, 2025 - Day 5 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ✅ **Completed**: Panda Data Sorting, Grouping and Aggregation Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python
- ✅ **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**:  Use raw strings (prefix with r) when calling my files, I need to sort_values(...) separately first before selecting fields and presenting the results.

### July 16, 2025 - Day 4 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ✅ **Completed**: Panda Data Filtering Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup + US Census Data CSV (www2.census.gov)
- ✅ **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**: Use .to_string(index=False) for clean console output, Always wrap conditions in parentheses when using & or | in pandas filters, Error handling: Check for and handle invalid or non-numeric values using pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')
- **Next Steps**: Pandas Additional Filtering, Sorting, Grouping and Aggregation

### July 15, 2025 - Day 3 Start
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ✅ **Completed**: SQL to Python translation exercises
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup
- ✅ **Progress**: Learned pandas data loading and basic exploration using real-world data from Kaggle
- **Challenges**: Adjusting to pandas syntax vs SQL queries
- **Breakthroughs**: Understanding DataFrames as "smart spreadsheets"

### July 14, 2025 - Day 1-2 Completion
**Focus**: Python for Programmers (Codecademy)
- ✅ **Completed**: Full Codecademy Python for Programmers course
- ✅ **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup
- ✅ **Progress**: Began panda exploration + data sources
- **Key Takeaways**: Python will be ongoing practice but going from Python 2 to Python 3 was managable. Initial data activity with panda and csv worked well.
- **Next Steps**: Moving to Pandas/SQL translation work
