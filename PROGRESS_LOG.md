## ðŸ“Š Daily Learning Log

### August 01, 2025 - Day 13 Progress
**Focus**: AI API Integration
- âœ… **Completed**: Building a Complete AI Enhanced Application
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + OpenAI + SQL Queries + Streamlit + JSON + REST
- âœ… **Progress**: Learned how all the pieces built so far start coming together in one application
- **Key Takeaways**: REST APIs aren't about data location - they're about system communication. Today I learned to build the bridge between databases, AI services, and business applications. This architectural thinking is what I will need for future AI implementation roles.

### July 30, 2025 - Day 12 Progress
**Focus**: AI API Integration
- âœ… **Completed**: Prompt Engineering for Data Analysis
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + OpenAI + SQL Queries
- âœ… **Progress**: Learned use cases for chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting, as well as roles for specific target audience
- **Key Takeaways**: Prompt styles can be combined for a very thorough evaluation of data. A template can be used by selecting the type of evaluation, then feeding the required `variables` in the call.  Prompting will take some practice to get the full value of the process.  I see why there are people that specialize in this process.

### July 29, 2025 - Day 11 Progress
**Focus**: AI API Integration
- âœ… **Completed**: OpenAI API Fundamentals
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + OpenAI + SQL Queries
- âœ… **Progress**: Tested OpenAI API call successfull and ran a couple of test analysis on SQLite and SQLExpress data.
- **Key Takeaways**: Noticed that SQL analysis used primarily Chat Completion tokens at OpenAI. This is not very expensive for small datasets vs. what I had been testing with Flowise workflows. I understand that JSON output (vs. human readable text outputs) enables automated decision-making and integration with other systems, due to the structure.  This will be important moving forward.

### July 25, 2025 - Day 10 Progress
**Focus**: Database connections with Python
- âœ… **Completed**: SQLExpress with SQLAlchemy- Local Database Connection and querying
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + SQL Server Management Studio
- âœ… **Progress**: Installed SQLExpress and SQL Server Management Studio, added sample databases, connected and ran SQL extraction with pandas
- **Key Takeaways**: Had an issue connecting at first but sorted out the Server Management set up to resolve it.  Got my `.env` setting for SQL set up quickly. Once in the Server Manager, I finally felt comfortable with a familiar environment.  I was able to test my queries in there before adding inside a lot of other code in Jupyter.

### July 24, 2025 - Day 9 Progress
**Focus**: Database connections with Python
- âœ… **Completed**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy- Local Database Connection and querying
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + PostgreSQL + pgAdmin
- âœ… **Progress**: Learned how to install and use postgreSQL, connected and combined SQL extraction with pandas manipulation
- **Key Takeaways**: Struggled a but with the `.env` concept so this took two days for both query practice and securing the connection with `.env` and `gitignore`. Wrapping SQL queries in engine connection and execute functions was different but I was grateful for the pgAdmin so I had a semi-familiar interface to look at the sample data to see what I wanted to pull. I probably should have practiced looking at the data using python panda but old habits are slow to die.

### July 21, 2025 - Day 8 Progress
**Focus**: Database connections with Python
- âœ… **Completed**: SQLite3 - Local Database Connection and querying
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + SQLite3 self created database
- âœ… **Progress**: Enhanced data analysis skill by combining SQL extraction with pandas manipulation
- **Key Takeaways**: Created reusable `connect_to_database()` function with proper error handling, built `execute_query_to_dataframe()` function - the workhorse pattern for AI data work, learned and practiced with secure parameter passing to prevent SQL injection

### July 20, 2025 - Day 7 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- âœ… **Completed**: Panda Cleaning and Transforming Data for SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + Seaborn Databases
- âœ… **Progress**: Null evaluation and transforming data for additional information availability
- **Key Takeaways**: Learned fill options for missing which is new to me. Also, pivot and pivot table - I had not done these items with queries, just excel. Data filling makes me a little uncomfortable as I worry about data integrity but will evaluate should the situation arise.

### July 18, 2025 - Day 6 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- âœ… **Completed**: Panda Data Merging and Joining Data Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + Dataframe in project / Seaborn Tips Database
- âœ… **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**: Merge, on, how is logical like joins in SQL. Suffixes are new as SQL can handle column names that are the same using table aliases. Concat with `.drop_duplicates()` functions like UNION, UNION ALL without that. Prefer to use `np.where()` rather than `pd.cut()` - it seems more logical and readable. By chance, learned \n next line formatting character to create a new line to space return data out. Also, using `observed=True` learned by a code update warning by Jupyter on one of my statements.

### July 17, 2025 - Day 5 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- âœ… **Completed**: Panda Data Sorting, Grouping and Aggregation Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python
- âœ… **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**:  Use raw strings (prefix with r) when calling my files, I need to sort_values(...) separately first before selecting fields and presenting the results.

### July 16, 2025 - Day 4 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- âœ… **Completed**: Panda Data Filtering Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup + US Census Data CSV (www2.census.gov)
- âœ… **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**: Use .to_string(index=False) for clean console output, Always wrap conditions in parentheses when using & or | in pandas filters, Error handling: Check for and handle invalid or non-numeric values using pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')
- **Next Steps**: Pandas Additional Filtering, Sorting, Grouping and Aggregation

### July 15, 2025 - Day 3 Start
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- âœ… **Completed**: SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup
- âœ… **Progress**: Learned pandas data loading and basic exploration using real-world data from Kaggle
- **Challenges**: Adjusting to pandas syntax vs SQL queries
- **Breakthroughs**: Understanding DataFrames as "smart spreadsheets"

### July 14, 2025 - Day 1-2 Completion
**Focus**: Python for Programmers (Codecademy)
- âœ… **Completed**: Full Codecademy Python for Programmers course
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup
- âœ… **Progress**: Began panda exploration + data sources
- **Key Takeaways**: Python will be ongoing practice but going from Python 2 to Python 3 was managable. Initial data activity with panda and csv worked well.
- **Next Steps**: Moving to Pandas/SQL translation work

## ðŸ”„ Weekly Reflections

### Week 3 (July 20-25, 2025)
**Theme**: Database connections with Python
- **Major Accomplishments**: 
    - Installed and configured 2 databases: postgresQL and SQL Server (SQL Express)
    - Succesfully connected to three different database formats
    - Learned how to use and update `.env` and `.gitignore`for secure connections
- **Challenges Overcome**: I really struggled with `.env` but found that my terminal was not defaulting to bash which created challenges. Once I sorted that out, I comfortably updated the file with regularity. Had to use some AI guidance to sort out my SQL Server connection issues but now that it is configured correctly, data pulls are working fine.
- **Key Learnings**: The similarity in the process is evident once you call a specific data source.  It makes sense, on a high level, how to pull data from different sources for AI evaluation.
- **Next Week Focus**: AI API Integration

### Week 2 (July 14-18, 2025)
**Theme**: Foundation Building
- **Major Accomplishments**: 
  - Completed Python refresher
  - Environment fully configured
  - Succcessful data interaction with increasingly complex handling
  - Successfully pivoted training approach
- **Challenges Overcome**: I was sturggling with cold code writing and visualization of the data results. This lead me to Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebooks - game changers!  I found help with coding to speed up my progress and much better view of what is happening both in code and on my github notes.
- **Key Learnings**: I am very comfortable with the dataframe concept and how to get data into a format that is useful.  Continued practice should make that smoother each week.
- **Next Week Focus**: Database connections and continued data manipulation
