## ðŸ“Š Daily Learning Log
### July 21, 2025 - Day 8 Progress
**Focus**: Database connections with Python
- âœ… **Completed**: SQLite3 - Local Database Connection and querying
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + SQLite3 self created database
- âœ… **Progress**: Enhanced data analysis skill by combining SQL extraction with pandas manipulation
- **Key Takeaways**: Created reusable `connect_to_database()` function with proper error handling, built `execute_query_to_dataframe()` function - the workhorse pattern for AI data work, learned and practiced with secure parameter passing to prevent SQL injection

### July 20, 2025 - Day 7 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- âœ… **Completed**: Panda Cleaning and Transforming Data for SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + Seaborn Databases
- âœ… **Progress**: Null evaluation and transforming data for additional information availability
- **Key Takeaways**: Learned fill options for missing which is new to me. Also, pivot and pivot table - I had not done these items with queries, just excel. Data filling makes me a little uncomfortable as I worry about data integrity but will evaluate should the situation arise.

### July 18, 2025 - Day 6 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Panda Data Merging and Joining Data Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python + Dataframe in project / Seaborn Tips Database
- âœ… **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**: Merge, on, how is logical like joins in SQL. Suffixes are new as SQL can handle column names that are the same using table aliases. Concat with `.drop_duplicates()` functions like UNION, UNION ALL without that. Prefer to use `np.where()` rather than `pd.cut()` - it seems more logical and readable. By chance, learned \n next line formatting character to create a new line to space return data out. Also, using `observed=True` learned by a code update warning by Jupyter on one of my statements.

### July 17, 2025 - Day 5 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Panda Data Sorting, Grouping and Aggregation Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook + Python
- âœ… **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**:  Use raw strings (prefix with r) when calling my files, I need to sort_values(...) separately first before selecting fields and presenting the results.

### July 16, 2025 - Day 4 Progress
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Panda Data Filtering Practice for SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup + US Census Data CSV (www2.census.gov)
- âœ… **Progress**: SELECT statements, WHERE clause filtering
- **Key Takeaways**: Use .to_string(index=False) for clean console output, Always wrap conditions in parentheses when using & or | in pandas filters, Error handling: Check for and handle invalid or non-numeric values using pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')
- **Next Steps**: Pandas Additional Filtering, Sorting, Grouping and Aggregation

### July 15, 2025 - Day 3 Start
**Focus**: Master Pandas for Data Manipulation
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: SQL to Python translation exercises
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup
- âœ… **Progress**: Learned pandas data loading and basic exploration using real-world data from Kaggle
- **Challenges**: Adjusting to pandas syntax vs SQL queries
- **Breakthroughs**: Understanding DataFrames as "smart spreadsheets"

### July 14, 2025 - Day 1-2 Completion
**Focus**: Python for Programmers (Codecademy)
- âœ… **Completed**: Full Codecademy Python for Programmers course
- âœ… **Environment**: VS Code + Python extension setup
- âœ… **Progress**: Began panda exploration + data sources
- **Key Takeaways**: Python will be ongoing practice but going from Python 2 to Python 3 was managable. Initial data activity with panda and csv worked well.
- **Next Steps**: Moving to Pandas/SQL translation work
